In this manner he was able to {col:92ffeb}\"weave\"{/col} the two styles together to become one of the most formidable hunters the Darkspear Tribe had ever seen.{/p}\n\n{p:c}Despite the Darkspear Tribe's pact with Thrall to no longer practice humanoid sacrifices and cannibalism, {col:ff6b79}Bohan{/col} frequently reminisces on the good 'ole days when such practices were still common. In fact, it is one of the few redeeming qualities that he sees in the {col:788aff}Forsaken{/col} as members of the Horde. {/p}\n\n{p:c}Amongst his {col:8aff85}Troll{/col} bretheren, {col:ff6b79}Bohan{/col} feels most at home in using the most cunning, guile, and deceptive tactics to achieve victory, but when surrounded by {col:ff66ef}Tauren{/col} or {col:ffda79}Orcs{/col} he tends to display more \"honorable\" tactics that the Horde prefers to espouse.{/p}",

A chilled wind passed by the soldier's depature.\n\nGabriel Ross is an undead soldier for the Forsaken, along with the newfound Horde allies. Though with humble beginings as a human - even through undeath - he has grown stalwart, loyal, and proud to the Forsaken cause and his fallen kingdom of Lordaeron. Physically imposing is his tactic toward his enemies, yet he will offer his body and strength to aid those in need as he fulfils his duties.\n\n\n{h2:c}Bright Beginnings{/h2}\nBorn as the first of the Ross family, grown to be oldest of a middle brother and youngest sister. From his mother's side, they were herbalists while his father's held the knowledge of alchemy and science. Though Gabriel was disinterested in his parent's professions, he grown respectful and thoughtful of their desires.\n \nAs a boy, his young hands became dirty of humble labor on a farm near the town of Brill. The child has learned to be responsible and compassionate under the old farmer's tasks. Coin was his reward for his hard work, and a means to save his family's dreams. The Ross' fledgling apothecary shop was to be taken away from the sudden risen taxes if it wasn't for the boy's offerings to keep it under their possession. The wealth was given to his parents willingly with a smile.\n\nAs the Blackrock threat grew in the Eastern Kingdoms, the growing young man took upon himself to enlist to the army of Lordaeron.

					["TX"] = "\nThe Hunter known as Trellin was found badly wounded and unconcious in the wreckage of a small Troll village following an attack by soliders loyal to Admiral Proudmore. He was brought to the Valley of Trials after he awoke with no recollection of his past. There, the troll witch doctors hoped that the trials for young adventers would re invigorate the healing voodoo inside of him. Before he began his adventure though, he adopted the moniker Trellin, as homage to Trellin village, where he had been found. \n\nWhile missing memories of his previous life, Trellin retains a few characteristics. While he is a volunteer in the militia, he rarely attacks Alliance unprovoked. He is skeptical of those who hold power, especially those who do not seem to deserve it. His sense of humor is rather jaded and dark, and does not always come across well to others. He also believes in a base level of equality, but the actions of beings can quickly degrade his opinion of them. \n\n--- The Adventures Of Trellin--\n\nAfter cleansing durotar of its many nuisances, Trellin adventured into the Barrens in hope of greater adventures. There, he met his first animal companion, Mayo. Mayo was a legendary silverback cougar who roamed the plains with his entourage. However, when Trellin found him, he had been badly wounded by a young orc who had attempted to kill him for sport. Trellin nursed Mayo back to health, and the two formed an unbreakable bond. \n\nTrellin and Mayo adventured throughout the Barrens together, slaying quillboars and cleansing the Wailing Caverns of its mysterious menace. However, the drums of war had begun to beat, and following a dastardly attack by the Alliance forces on the Crossroads, Trellin enlisted in the militia. \n\nIn their first battle, Horde forces numbering at least 120 crossed the Great Sea and snaked their way through the perilous Stranglethorn Vale. Their target was the peaceful town of Redridge, for the Horde wanted blood. They ransacked their way through duskwood, killing all those unfortunate enough to be in their path. However, unfortunately for the militia, an Alliance scout had spotted them and arranged for an Army to defend Lakeshire. Despite the fact that this Alliance army had been fortified with the elite soldiers of the Imperial Guard, the Horde ran headlong into battle, screaming for vengeance and blood.\n\nUltimately, the numerical superiority of the Alliance army was able to rout the Horde, and the militia made a tactical retreat to the bridge that connected Duskwood to Redridge. There, they made a valiance final stand. Trellin distinguished himself in the battle, with precise shooting that downed dozens of young alliance soldiers. Inevitably, he and the milita where overwhelmed. Luckily, Trellin was among those lucky enough to hide in some bushes and cast a hearth spell. They regrouped in Crossroads to lick their wounds and prepare for another battle.\n\nFollowing this disasterous defeat, Trellin decided to wander the world while the militia built up its strength. When he returned, he found his militia had disbanded and been absorbed into another, bigger one. Instead of following them, Trellin decided to join a tribe of his troll bretheren instead, Atal'Alarion.\n\nChapter 2 - Onwards and Outwards\n\nTrellin and his faithful companion Mayo continued to explore the world, gathering new skills and experiences. They conquered the Quillboar tribes of the Barrens. They burned the Grimtotem outposts of Thousand Needles. The Night Elves  quaked in fear of the stories of the duo, as they pillaged their way through Ashenvale. However, disaster soon struck.  \n\n\n\n",

These druids used relics and artifacts that, in the right hands, could be sold for more than livable wages to the right people. Apprehensive at first, Slego brushed it off until he saw a trapping expedition into the caves for deviate hides.

At the heart of all darkness is the preponderance of darkness to self destruct, and Mal'al is the embodiment of that, The one who uses darkness to fight darkess, to serve that which they hate, to laugh in the face of utter despair, and to dive deeper into the dark such that the dark cannot exist,\n\n{h3:c}Fall of the Tribe{/h3}\n\nFollowing a period of strife and turmoil the proud tribe of Atal'Alarion splintered. Many going their separate ways. Whether that was to the Redwood tribes to find refuge, the Blacktooth grin to find vengeance or Hand of Lordaeron to find new purpose.\n\nRho'Deesa is unwilling, or perhaps unable, to move on. He remains as the last priest of the fallen tribe. Guiding others who seek a new home, or comforting those who remain to keep the memories alive.\n",

					["TX"] = "{h2:c}WIP{/h2}\n{h1:c}A more detailed narrative will be here soon{/h1}\n\n  Born in the gargantuan city of Stratholme, the teenager that would later be known as Virulen had much to long for.  With no mother, he grew up in a household with a father who was rarely home from work as a successful stonemason.  What time he did have that wasn't spent lost in his head was nose-deep in a book.  From the free books at the chapel to the books, the books he could afford from his meager and occasional labor, to even the books the sweet custodian managed to sneak him from a nearby academy, he devoured whatever literary scrap his hands could grab.  However, nothing could separate him from his interest in the Dalaran Mages; a cabal of mages so powerful as to break the fabric of space and matter, his dreams of becoming a Dalaran wizard stayed with him through the night and carried into his fantasies in the day.\n  So of course, when a shady figure who he had, by chance, conversed with about magic near the academy offered him a chance to join an academy - run by the organization founded by a council member of the Kirin Tor, no less - there was not a doubt in his mind.  Whatever this Cult of the Damned was, he wanted to absorb their knowledge, rise to the level of their masters, and exert his will.  Discontent with the social strife of the city, and the lack of any social activity in his own life, he set off to a new one.  The teenager shirked his name, and took up a new one in an attempt to fit in; {col:7604BA}Virulen{/col}, based on his particular interest in slow, decaying magics.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Alas, while the student once looked quite promising with expansive background knowledge and ability to pick up facts and recitations rapidly, his practical ability was not quite up to par.  In fact, it was easily the least impressive of his generation of students.  Shuffled from topic to topic, in an attempt for the instructors to find something for the young, fretting student to excel at, he practiced shadow magic, mind domination, summoning, elemental magic, and even bits of alchemy as a last ditch resort to salvage something from the top-heavy teen.  But despite all efforts, the students awkwardness and immaturity impeded any useful progress.\n  For the masters, however, no recruit is ever wasted... if they cannot perform tests, then they can have tests performed ON them.  The ritual was dark and painful; his instructor, a ravishing high elf, branded his face amid curious and humored onlookers with an arcane tool that burns underneath the skin, through the skull and into the brain.  Having been turned into a test dummy for the newer students, Virulen endured test upon torture upon torment from the students, be it for learning, business... or pleasure.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  After some time, incalculable by the near-destroyed victim, an opportunity arose: a younger student, in a cocky attempt to demonstrate prowess far beyond their years, aimed to impress her peers by casting a mind control spell on the boy.  While feigning subservience for several hours, the girl wanted to test the extent of her control and new minion's ability increasingly by giving him a task situated a larger distance from their location.  Having been tasked to fetch a book to the library, close to the castle's entrance, Virulen walked slowly and dumbly to its location, being questioned by absolutely none of the staff or students as he passed.  Acting calmly, he slowly walked out the door of the castle near the entrance; by the time he had exited, outside and out of sight, he made a mad dash across the bridge and towards the farmlands of central Lordaeron.\n  Having traveled through rocky and hostile terrain, he finally approached on the city of Andorhal.  Happening upon a lone man outside the city, he began begging, with the last bit of vitality that was dwindling from his soul, for any sort of nourishment or safety.  He was too distraught to notice the horribly ill man staring, and approaching with fatal intent.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The senses returned to... his body.  Not quite him - it felt like his soul was somewhere else.  Or maybe it felt like it was nowhere, because it didn't belong anywhere.\n\n(Still writing)",

Ratbag was a lame warrior, only meant to be fodder to all that would oppose the newfound Horde.\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-rogue-cover:256:256}\n\n    A young orc set out to be an adventurer for glory, gold, and to serve his clan. The roads outside Horde territory took Ratbag to hellish places. He was separated from the rest of the infantry and was forced to survive off of scraps and the wildlife. He didn't even know that the Horde lost until he heard they were coming back once more, under the leadership of Orgrim Doomhammer. Still separated, Ratbag went to disrupt enemy lines.\n\n    Ratbag was immediately captured and sent to one of the many internment camps ran by Aedelas Blackmore. Ratbag's hope for his people faded as he saw his fellow prisoners lose their energy and will to fight back. Ratbag was unaware that this was due to warlock magic rather than the death of the orcish spirit.\n\n    He lost hope in his people. The only thing that kept him going was the hatred for the humans that put him in there. It was degrading, being treated like animals. He considered the Alliance to be the greatest of evils.\n\n    Ratbag would escape in the dead of night; no one cared that he was gone. Ratbag would come to find that he couldn't return home to Draenor and that he had failed in his attempts to protect those he cared about. He would spend day and night training to fight not with strength, but with cunning and brutality.\n\n    He'd end up doing little things to harass the Allied races, poisoning wells, killing livestock, and cutting off supply lines where he could. Once Warcheif Thrall took leadership of the Horde, he took some solace in that now he won't be alone in the slaughter of the Alliance.\n\n    Ratbag would eventually meet up with the Blackrock Clan in Blackrock Mountain - the city of Hordemar. His experience in subterfuge made him the best and only canidate for Rend Blackhand's Spymaster. \n\n    Despite his newfound hope, Ratbag's mind had been damaged to the point of no return. His mind had become muddled and lacking nuance. Today he fights not for the people he loves, but for those he hates.",

The dazzling colors only a blur to Izebel before she rubbed her eyes. Her room only had one window, a mosaic depicting a crimson monastery, beaming with rays of light extending to the edges of the glass. Izebel's mind cleared, she knew she could not stay in her bed for long. Duties need to be fulfilled.\n\nIzebel got up and prepared herself for the day. She left her room and headed down the hall when Sister Cassiel burst out of her room, looking flustered. \"It is good to see you, Sister.\" Izebel said with a wry smile. \"Sister Izebel, Good Morning!\" stammered the young woman, she was still relatively new to the convent, only being there for a few months now. Izebel was a veteran in comparison, joining the convent almost 20 years ago as a young girl. Izebel examined the new sister intently and noticed the disheveled appearance of her collar. \"Sister Cassiel...\" Izebel said warmly as she adjusted and smoothed out the woman's collar, \"calm yourself sister, I won't tell anybody you slept late.\" Cassiel looked upon Izebel as a mentor ever since she joined the Convent of the Light after the loss of her parents.\n\nThe Head Mother of the Convent was Mother Jophiel. She was an strict disciplinarian who lead the aging monastery in the foothills of Lordaeron. The all-female convent spent most hours of the day studying the light and keeping the monastery maintained. Many learned how to preform healing spells, but only a few displayed real mastery of the magic. Izebel was naturally gifted. She used her mastery to heal the sick and taught other sisters how to improve their healing magic and became well-liked among all the convent, even Mother Jophiel, despite some lingering jealousy.\n\n\n\n\n{h2:c}PART II{/h2}\n{h2:c}DEATH{/h2}\n\n\nOne day, Sister Izebel and Cassiel were out in the woods, collecting herbs for the convent. They strolled here and there, up over ridges, and down into valleys. The weather was perfect, the sun shone down like a pleasant waterfall of light, a springy breeze kept the trees and grass alive-looking.  This was part of Izebel and Cassiel's routine. Izebel stopped them for a break.\n\n\"Cassie, How many more herbs can you carry?\" Izebel asked her friend.\n\n\"Only a little bit more I think, we can probably start heading back and fill our bags on the way back.\" answered Sister Cassiel.\n\n\"Me too\" said Izebel, \"it shouldn't take that long to get back, but it will be night soon\" She looked around at the landscape surrounding them. \"We need to head back south along the mountain range, then we will intersect the river going east until we reach the monastery.\" \n\nNot long after she said that did the two hear a wolf howl in the distance, then another closer but still distant. The two avoided the subject, for fear of mentioning it would suddenly bring the wolves upon them. They did not stop to pick any more herbs. The howls kept up with them. They quickened their pace. A sense of dread filled them both with panic. Like a runner at the last stretch of a race, they sprinted towards the monastery, dropping the bags of herbs on the cobblestone. The sunset reflecting off the monastery gave the building a crimson hue. They slammed into the front door and entered the chapel.\n\nBefore Izebel could say anything to the surprised sisters inside, a deep-throated roar, like that of a monster but worse, bellowed behind Izebel. She turned around and a male orc was in front of the main gate.\n\nIzebel was terrified. The orc's blood-red, bluging eyes stared at Sister Cassiel as if he was obsessed with her. He grabbed his crude axe and charged at the two, mouth agape and quick for his hulking size. Fear paralyzed Izebel, she could do nothing but watch in horror as the orc brought his axe down upon Sister Cassiel's head, splitting her down the middle. Izebel and the sisters were speechless, as the orc yanked his axe out of the remains of Sister Cassiel. Suddenly coming to her senses, Izebel blasted the orc with holy energy, knocking him off his feet.\n\n\"Run sisters, follow me, I will protect you!\" Izebel commanded the sisters in the chapel, still in shock and grief of what they just witnessed. Izebel led the sisters out of the chapel. Howls broke out so close the sisters knew another attack was imminent. In a moment the sisters were surrounded by orcs riding wolves and the orc from earlier apparently recovered from Izebel's spell.\n\nThe wolves pounced on the sisters. They could not fight back, but the orcs found they could not kill their prey. Any wounds inflicted were healed quickly, leaving no trace of any blood. The orcs turned their eyes to Izebel. She was the one healing all the sisters and keeping them alive at her own expense. She was not healing herself, her own wounds evidence enough. The orcs and wolves closed in upon Izebel.\n\nIzebel told her sisters to escape and find help. The wolves and orcs tore at her body only for it to quickly heal was like torture. The pain was worse than Izebel ever experienced, over and over again being ripped apart by wolves and orcs. Her sisters fled, desperately searching for the Head Mother.\n\nAs Izebel's final mana reserves dried up, her healing magics ceased and she found peace....or so she thought.\n\n\n\n\n{h2:c}PART III{/h2}\n{h2:c}UNDEATH{/h2}\n\n\nIzebel's service to the scourge was like an unending nightmare. A ravenous hunger, unable to be satiated, but only desiring the flesh of the living. Animalistic, impulsive, blind, total mind domination.\n\nIzebel steadily returned to consciousness as the Lich King's power waned. Izebel, disgusted by the undeath that surrounded her, fled to the hills, seeking her old home. After days of wandering around lost in the wilderness, Izebel came to terms with what she had become. Wandering death, an abomination held together with stitches made of crude cords. Four of her fingers were not her own. Her head was literally held together with staples and leather straps. After months pass, she finally found her convent, but it’s nothing more than a charred ruin, destroyed by the scourge. She goes to the graveyard curious to see if anyone was buried there since she was there last, thinking about her sisters.\n\nIzebel walked to the monastery graveyard, but only found two new gravestones. One was for Sister Cassiel, the other for...Saint Izebel Azazel? That was Izebel's name, but that title... Was she bestowed a sainthood by the convent? Yes, Izebel did not witness it, but nobody else died besides her and Sister Cassiel that day, and the Head Mother together with the surviving sisters named her Saint Izebel Azazel of the Convent of the Light.\n\nSaint Izebel pondered the fate of the convent. She guessed her sisters were probably killed by the scourge or orcs, but it did not matter either way. There was nothing for her here, nothing she could return to. Losing faith in the light, she walked out of the monastery and never returned.",

					["TX"] = "{h1:c}Introduction{/h1}\n\nHe leans against the wall with tight lips and a sleepy look in his eyes. The whites of his eyes glow dimly from within, yellow like foggy gnomish bulbs, a spark flickering in each pupil. Their luminescence makes eye color difficult to discern. In life his straw blond hair and thick chin strap beard might have made him ruggedly disheveled, though the affect is now lost to decay. \n\nSomething wriggles beneath his skin. It looks uncomfortable, even painful. Occasionally he twitches or stops to scratch at the source of the irritation. His brows pinch only slightly. If he's suffering he's not going to let it show.\n\nBy all appearences he seems to have adjusted well to undeath. Only the rum flask clutched in his right hand suggests otherwise. Whether the effect is merely psychosomatic even he cannot say. Best not to think about it. Why spoil one's own happiness with sobering questions?\n\n{h1:c}Before the Scourge{/h1}\n\nIf you lived in Tirisfal or the Capital City of Lordaeron during the plague, you might remember Lyle. You're not sure if his family lived in the city - you never met them and he never spoke of them - but you may have seen him walking the church grounds when he was alive. Or maybe you knew him from the seedy bar in Brill, where he wasted his teenage years gambling and bruising his knuckles until he found the Light's salvation. He seemed like an ordinary priest in those days, if a bit secretive. \n\nThat is not to say Lyle was ever without friends. He was highly gregarious and enjoyed the company of a variety of people from different walks of life, with few exceptions. You're not sure you ever saw him with a woman. \n\nWhen the plague struck Lyle and several other priests were dispatched to the surrounding towns and villages to investigate and heal the sick. While tending to the ill Lyle and his friends heard screams of horror coming from outside the make-shift hospital. Seeing the chaos outside the priests desperately tried to barracade the doors and windows. In moments the living dead burst through, claws and teeth glistening with bile and freshly spilled blood, and ravaged the hospital. Unable to save his friends, Lyle escaped through a second story window and fled in terror.\n\nOf Lyle's group only he returned to Lordaeron alive, bloodied and shaken to his core, one of the first unfortunate souls who beared witness to the plague's true nature. He never ventured beyond the city walls again... at least, not in life.\n\nLyle perished when the Scourge seiged Lordaeron. A dreadblade pierced him through from behind as he fled. In the following days his body was dragged from the mass grave in which it had been carelessly thrown, infused with necromancy, and sent to toil in the mines of Deathknell.\n\nPerhaps this was divine punishment. \n\n{h1:c}A New Purpose{/h1}\n\nAs the Lich King's power waned Lyle returned to his senses in Deathknell. Now shunned by the Light and riddled with flesh eating maggots, he wandered Tirisfal in a daze, seeking anything to distract him from his miserable new existance. Service to the Dark Lady seemed the only logical choice. Lordaeron was his home, after all. Who else but the undead would tolerate his presense now?\n\nWhile traveling through Silverpine he learned of an organization called the Hand of Lordaeron, whose Forsaken members sought to defend and reclaim their homeland from thieving Alliance and relentless Scourge alike. Intrigued, he joined their cause.\n\nAt first the Hand was merely a place to meet new friends and rest his feet. As time passed his dedication to Mortarion's goals deepened. The Hand blessed him with purpose and renewed vigor and he repays them in loyalty and the blood of their mutual enemies. \n\n{h1:c}The Forgotten Shadow{/h1}\n\nIn death Lyle's ambitions turned from giving life to ripping it away. While he will readily heal his companions when neccessity demands it (or they promise to repay him in drink) he claims to heal with \"Spite\" rather than Light. \n\nAs a follower of the Cult of the Forgotten Shadow, Lyle attempts to live by the three virtues of Respect, Tenacity, and Power. Strangely, his resentment for the Light does not prevent him from finding balance. The compulsion to lift up the weak and heal the wounded remains strong within his soul, stronger even than the Light's agonizing flames and inspired hatred, while the Shadow envelopes him in cold solace. It is the Shadow he favors. ",

					["TX"] = "Marius Summerwand was a young, but well respected mage in the Dalarani order of mages due to his awesome talents in manipulating the arcane energies. He rose quickly in their ranks and as such he oversaw the selection of dozens of new children with the potential of harnessing the arcane magics for the protection of his king and the Alliance. \n\nHe also participated in the Troll experimentations. Dalarani business was beyond the law and was known only to those who lived, worked, and studied in the magical city. The experiments on lower sub-species was an unpleasant task, but necessary to determine how these beings accessed and used the arcane energies and how such creatures with and without access to these powers reacted to different spells so when the Alliance went to war the mages of Dalaran would be able to help swiftly and confidently defeat the enemy. \n\nAt any given time there were approximately 500 sub-species of Troll, Orcs, Tauren, Elves and Dwarves undergoing experimentation. Marius Summerwand worked with the dozen or so trolls which showed an aptitude for healing. The conditions where the experimented on lived were atrocious. This was done purposely to prevent their magics from flourishing and mounting an attack on their captors.\n\nOne young female troll in particular was a favourite of his to work with. Jemmanda was one of 8 trolls that were part of a sacrifice which her tribe had made in order to secure their freedom from future attacks from the Alliance. The younger of a set of identical twins she was viewed as expendable, especially since she drove the tribe to frustration and distraction with her outspokenness, sassy attitude towards the elders, and penchant for not doing or being what and where she was supposed to be. Nevertheless, she was adept with healing and nature magics, almost to the point of being dangerous. The tribe was glad to be rid of her. \n\nMost of the Trolls that Marius worked with were feisty to start with, their magics unpredictable and explosive. As their spirits became more downtrodden, they started using their magic less and less. Jemmanda was the exception. She fought him and the other mages every time they brought her in for an examination, refusing to cooperate and even learning some words in Common to toss insults their way in her thick accent. Yet, when observed indirectly while she was with the other trolls, she was seen as kind and caring and she subtly used her healing magics to help their injured body and spirits. She had an ability to help not just her fellow trolls but the sparse bits of foliage which grew around their imprisonment area. She could coax them to grow a little faster and from those plants she was able to help ease her co-captives hunger.\nMarius, wanting to learn more about the abilities that Jemmanda displayed decided to separate her from the group experiments and chose to work one on one with her. Twenty years old at this time, having already been through this torture for the previous six years her spirit continued to be indomitable. Marius, a progressive thinker among his fellow mages decided on a different tactic when dealing with her. Forcing her to use her magic and ordering her weren’t yielding the result he was looking for, so he started talking to her, teaching her his language and giving her small treats.\n\nTo be continued\n\n",

					["TX"] = "{h1:c}{col:00FFFD}Master Gin'jojo{/col}{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{col:FCFFF0}Born on the Darkspear Isles just before the First War, Gin'jojo was only a child when the orcs of Draenor first spilled into Azeroth. He and his brother Kaz'sul grew into fine young trolls on the Isles. Raised by their father Gin'sul, a hunter in the tribe and their mother, Nasesa who practiced dark magics. Zufli! \"Baby Witch\" is what they called his mother for being a female Witch Doctor, but that did not matter to Gin'jojo. His mother was strong and cared for them greatly. Time passed and they grew older and life was good. Other then the occasionally conflict with the murlocs it was peaceful, until the greenskins known as orcs landed on their Island...\n\nThe conflict with the murlocs took a turn for the worse when the humans of Kul Tiras landed on the islands in search of Thrall and his orcs. Together they defeated the humans, but thir victory was short-lived. Controlled by the Sea Witch Zar'jira, her minions captured the Chieftain Sen'jin and the other trolls alon with Thrall and his orcs. They were all brought to an underground prison made from the caves beneath the islands.\n\nThrall freed himself along with the others and Gin'jojo's family but was unable to save Sen'jin who became a sacrifice to the Sea Witch. Upon returning to the surface Gin'jojo, Kaz'sul and their father Gin'sul fought alongside Thrall and the orcs. The Sea Witch sent wave after wave of her murloc minions against them and all was lost for the young brothers as the murlocs backed them into a corner. Their father, Gin'sul in a last-ditched effort to protect his sons fell against the swarm of murlocs. Thrall with the help of the others managed to push them back and made their way to the ships the orcs had brought. With the loss of their father the young brothers and their mother accompanied the orcs on their way to Kalimdor.\n\nDuring their trip across the sea the young brothers often spent their time top deck climbing the masts to watch the waves. Gin'jojo particularly loved it more than his brother and it would soon spell disaster for him during one rough day at sea when he fell from the mast into the dark waters below. His brother ran to the edge of the ship and called the others for help, but it was too late. His was gone...\n\nGin'jojo crashed into the ocean the young troll tried calling out for help but the water only filled his lungs. \"Was dis de end of him?' he thought. \"To survive all de ordeals me Tribe has suffered and me fathers sacrifice just to drown in de ocean?\" He began to blackout...sinking deeper and deeper into the waves all seemed lost. Untill a booming voice came from the depths, \"Do not fear little one.\" The voice said. Suddenly breath entered his lungs and he awoke. \"Wh..who are you?\" Gin'jojo asked. The voice spoke again. \"I am Gral the Shark, Loa of the Sea and you are in my realm little one.\" Gin'jojo's heart filled with joy at the sound of the Loa's voice. \"Why have you saved me?\" Gin'jojo asked the Loa. \"Your Tribe has suffered much from the Sea Witch and her minions little one and I have plans for you.\" Gral said with a voice that began to vibrate the water around Gin'jojo. \"What are you doin' to me?\" The young troll asked. Gral's voiced boomed once more \"The Naga are an enemy of mine and yours, Gin'jojo and I know many things...including the arcane magic they use. Take this knowledge and use it against them, avenge your father and tribesmen.\" The power Gral gave him began to overflow into his mind as his body tried to keep up with the arcane knowledge...he passed out and Gral's voice grew distant \"Go now little one, find your brother and help your people rebuild what was lost.\"\n\nGin'jojo awoke, washed onto the shores of the Echo Isles. With his head pounding he made his way deeper into the isles, there he found his people. \"Gin'jojo!\" Kaz'sul yelled as he rushed to embrace his brother. \"We thought we had lost ya, mon!\" Gin'jojo embraced his brother and told him what had happened...\n\nWeeks went by and the brothers helped the other trolls carve out another home for themselves in the Echo Isles. However even their new home did not last, the humans of Kul Tiras and its navy attacked the Echo Isles and forced the trolls to retreat inland. Gin'jojo with his new power, fought alongside his brother and their Horde brethren led by Rexxar and helped evacuate their Tribe into the Duskwallow Marsh. There they helped the Horde gather its forces and defeated the Kul Tiras threat. The Darkspear moved back into the Echo Isles, but even then Gin'jojo's time fighting wasnt over. The Hexxmaster Zalazane had betrayed them! He began to use his dark magic to take the minds of his fellow Darkspear including Gin'jojo's own mother, Nasesa. Vol'jin ordered the others whose minds were free to evacuate once again, Zalazane took control over the Echo Isles. Gin'jojo and his brother followed Vol'jin to the shoreline, settling into what is now called Sen'jin Village in honor to the old leader. Having almost every home taken from him, Gin'jojo under the orders of Vol'jin went out into Durotar to seek more allies to help defend their new land, there he meet  the Tauren of the Redwood Tribes lead by Chieftain Ayashe Brightmane. He and his brother along with a few trolls that followed them forged a pact with the Redwood Tauren to help protect Kalimdor and Horde lands at all cost...{/col}{/p}\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\Arch-Race-OrcBIG:256:512}\n",

I thought of the places beyound our montains. My Father always said.{/p}\n{p:c}Furjord Runetotem{/p}\n{p:c}\"Look to the horizon, you can see the mountians that guard our home. But past them? The land streches so far that you can only see the sky that hovers over them. And when you get to those lands, the lands goes ever further then that. To where you can stil only see the sky that hovers over them.\"{/p}\n\n{p:r}My Mother would scold Him, becasue She thought He was scaring me. But it just made me want to see the world more. I would ask Him \"How?\" how do you see the world?{/p}\n{p:c}Furjord Runtotem{/p}\n{p:r}\"Well, you put one hoof in front of the other. You will get there. Could be an hour, could be two. Could be a day, could be two. Could be a week, could be two. Could be a month, could be two. Could be a year, could be two.{/p}\n\n{p:r}\"You will get there.\"{/p}\n\n{p:r}My Mother was stout and patient. I proved to be from my mother when I would quietly wait for someone to be done. Only for them to be shocked that I was doing it at all. She would say.{/p}\n{p:c}Klooth Runtotem{/p}\n{p:r}\"There is no rush. We have a whole day to use. And if it is not done today. We will use tomarrow to get it done. And if not we will continue this till it is done. Whatever that task may be.\"{/p}\n\n{p:r}They were travlers. They traveld as far north as Felwwod and as far south as Tanaris. Even going to a place called the Swamp of Sorrows. With their travles they found and sold many herbs, spices, fish, and rum. They both did everything; fought, cooked, gathered, traded, negotiated. They had endless stoires to tell me. But then the Second War started.{/p}\n\n{p:r}My Father went to fill in the ranks for polearm users, while my mother went in as a healer. I was left in the care of Gart Mistrunner and Kawnie Softbreeze. It was not that loney per say. Other children were going throiugh it as well. It was an odd way to comfort yourself. Very little news come back. We had gained some ground, we had lost some ground. I just knew that \"They will get there.\" where ever there was. And that they will \"Use the whole day to get it done\"., and if not. Well they will use all of tomorrow and continue till it is done. what ever task they need to do.{/p}\n\n{p:r}I was helping Gart Mistrunner getting some long grass to make some basketst. But as I was gathering I could see the wind ride the grass across the fields. I have been told often that it may look like the wind is coming for you. It never is. But with Gart teachings I have been able to predicted the weather a few times. And give them news from the front before mail ever reach the crossroads. This felt different today. As it got closer it was not moveing very fast. And I could see two leafs riding the wind...always together...never being apart.{/p}\n\n{p:r}The wind slowed to a stop and the leafs fell on my lap. It was two very red autumn leafs...it was summer. I did not know what to do. So I went back to getting what Gart needed. I heard Him say He was heading back and to follow Him. I picked up the leafs and grass and went with Him. When we got back Kawnie asked why I was crying. I had not noticed it, but I felt my face and my fur was soaked. I told them what I had witnessed. And like any adult comforting a child; they told me it meant nothing, that I should not be scared. But a month later news came in that the horde sufferd a massive defeat.{/p}\n\n{p:r}It felt like a dream the next year. As other saw family return, the wind was the only thing that greeted me on those days. I was taken in by the Runtotem Clan, but resentment grew in my heart. I hated it, but the teachings of the Druids was all I had. I went alone into the fields and plains to often they said. I did not care. Being with others pained me to much. But...the pain I harbored was not greater then the pain I felt not helping someone in need. Wether it was with a child younger then me that had gotten a cut for the first time. Or a hunter who tracked the wrong animal back to its den. I could not be idle, I had to care for them.{/p}\n\n{p:r}They thanked me; they praised me for my skill. An empty smile was all I could give them. Soon others would run to me as if I were an elder; as I were an excellent healer, but also preferd to be alone. But even when I was alone I was not alone. The wind kept hounding me. Every time I was alone it was there. Every time it would bring a leaf that would signify the next season. For THREE years the wind did this. Always...landing right in front of me. At first it gave me hope that they would come back. But the second year coming to a close told me they were not. The Wind tried to be nice and help me at times. Putting something just out of reach in reach.....like a parent to a child.{/p}\n\n{p:r}Every season...one after another...like my hoofs. \"You will get there.\" Then being alone was to meditate instead of just the sake of it. I had to let go of my anger to reach a deeper meditation. The Wind felt less mocking then it had before. instead of going to the meditation rocks that my teachers told me, I went to the tree we sat under. There were more disreaction then by the rocks, but I kept at it for a week...\"till the task is done.\" And...I felt them...breifly. But it was enough to send me down a waterfall of emotions. They came back. Before anyone else had.{/p}\n\n{p:c}Notes/unfinished thoughts/opinons{/p}\n\nBut it is foolish to just leave your home wihtout the ablility to defend one self. Which one would think that it would be more then learning how to swing a stick. i got into some trouble with the boar folk that are still a threat to my people\n\n{p:r}Being a part of the Runetotem clan, I found a calling to the ways of the druids. But as I trained; I noticed more and more orcs, trolls traveld to our lands. I never learnd troll speak, but something about orcish was difficult. I eveuntaly learned to understand them, but speak it for myself? all i ever get is scratched heads when i speak the orc tonge. Then the thin dead looking humans started showing up as well. I was quite a shock to learn that they were a part of the Scourge.{/p}\n\n{p:r}And then to find out that Thrall did infact ally with the Undead Scourge. Now know as the Forsaken. Things must be bad with the Alliance to have them as allys. It does not help that they have Warlocks. But its something that i do agree with other orc's conserns. That Thrall is too trusting. To have \"retired\" memebers of the Burning Legion teach new warlocks is foolish{/p}",

She had healed the sick and fed the hungry.  She watched over her friends and neighbors, granting them advice and blessings.  When she passed, she had a humbly decorated but highly visited funeral.   It had been a peaceful and dignified end for a follower of The Light.\n\nIf only she had stayed dead.  \n\nMany years later--long after her flesh had rotted away--she was raised from the dead through dark and terrible magics; something so opposite of her life's ideals that it tore apart her soul and mind. Two years she spent under the thrall of the Lich King, an old crone beaten and subjugated into a broken shell of her former self.\n\nIt was a bittersweet relief when her thoughts became her own. Bitter in that now she had to come to terms with her undeath. Sweet in that she was herself again.\n\nOr... at least as close as she could get to being herself.\n\nOne thing is for certain, the world she is in now is much different.  What are these orcs and tauren?  What on Azeroth is a Night Elf??  Also, she never recalled any human leaders named Menethil or Proudmoore.  Back in her day, all she and her people worried about were Trolls.  How long had she been dead?\n\nRegardless, she has grown rather fond of The Horde.  They have been (mostly) accepting of her.  The Frostwolf Clan has been particularly kind to her, and she feels incredibly indebted to them.\n\nHowever, to this day, she debates with herself.  Should she return to her homeland and let her remaining countrymen kill her?  That would certainly silence the rattling inside her head.   Or perhaps... perhaps she can find a new meaning in this life. \n\nThe Light has not left Sister Dahleea.  As much as it burns her from the inside out, her old friend has remained with her. \n\n",

They never did know. The darkness manifesting itself deep within the crevice of your heart and mind, gnawing, yearning for a way out. Begging to be released.

When Sylvanas broke away, Silas was one of the first to go with her. With his freedom restored, he instinctively tapped into holy magic to repair his body. Instead of relief, he felt indescribable pain, as if his entire body was on fire.  He spent days fasting and praying, hoping that any residual taint of the Scourge would fade. He tried again, and again felt the flames licking his body. The Light had rejected Silas\n\nCut off from the one thing that gave him reason to live, Silas tore off the amulet of his former Church and smashed it against the rocks. He resolved to return to Hearthglen, sit under his favorite tree, and let his bones crumble to dust. As he walked, his mind wandered. He thought of the dark wizards and necromancers  he rooted out, how they could sustain their evil creations. A thought formed in his mind: perhaps he could use their methods to sustain himself. If the Light would not cure him, he could \"cure\" himself.\n\nRemembering what he had heard and read, he attempted to call on the very magic his life was spent trying to destroy. A nearby rat was captured, and he began to siphon the life from it. He felt the power fill him, giving strength to his rotting limbs. If he still had a working stomach, he would have vomited. But the ritual had worked; he was closer to life. Silas now knew what must be done...\n ",
