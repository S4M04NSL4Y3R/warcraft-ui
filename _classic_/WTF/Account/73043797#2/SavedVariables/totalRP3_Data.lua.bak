					["TX"] = "{h1:c}Introduction{/h1}\n\nHe leans against the wall with tight lips and a sleepy look in his eyes. The whites of his eyes glow dimly from within, yellow like foggy gnomish bulbs, a spark flickering in each pupil. Their luminescence makes eye color difficult to discern. In life his straw blond hair and thick chin strap beard might have made him ruggedly disheveled, though the affect is now lost to decay. \n\nSomething wriggles beneath his skin. It looks uncomfortable, even painful. Occasionally he twitches or stops to scratch at the source of the irritation. His brows pinch only slightly. If he's suffering he's not going to let it show.\n\nBy all appearences he seems to have adjusted well to undeath. Only the rum flask clutched in his right hand suggests otherwise. Whether the effect is merely psychosomatic even he cannot say. Best not to think about it. Why spoil one's own happiness with sobering questions?\n\n{h1:c}Before the Scourge{/h1}\n\nIf you lived in Tirisfal or the Capital City of Lordaeron during the plague, you might remember Lyle. You're not sure if his family lived in the city - you never met them and he never spoke of them - but you may have seen him walking the church grounds when he was alive. Or maybe you knew him from the seedy bar in Brill, where he wasted his teenage years gambling and bruising his knuckles until he found the Light's salvation. He seemed like an ordinary priest in those days, if a bit secretive. \n\nThat is not to say Lyle was ever without friends. He was highly gregarious and enjoyed the company of a variety of people from different walks of life, with few exceptions. You're not sure you ever saw him with a woman. \n\nWhen the plague struck Lyle and several other priests were dispatched to the surrounding towns and villages to investigate and heal the sick. While tending to the ill Lyle and his friends heard screams of horror coming from outside the make-shift hospital. Seeing the chaos outside the priests desperately tried to barracade the doors and windows. In moments the living dead burst through, claws and teeth glistening with bile and freshly spilled blood, and ravaged the hospital. Unable to save his friends, Lyle escaped through a second story window and fled in terror.\n\nOf Lyle's group only he returned to Lordaeron alive, bloodied and shaken to his core, one of the first unfortunate souls who beared witness to the plague's true nature. He never ventured beyond the city walls again... at least, not in life.\n\nLyle perished when the Scourge seiged Lordaeron. A dreadblade pierced him through from behind as he fled. In the following days his body was dragged from the mass grave in which it had been carelessly thrown, infused with necromancy, and sent to toil in the mines of Deathknell.\n\nPerhaps this was divine punishment. \n\n{h1:c}A New Purpose{/h1}\n\nAs the Lich King's power waned Lyle returned to his senses in Deathknell. Now shunned by the Light and riddled with flesh eating maggots, he wandered Tirisfal in a daze, seeking anything to distract him from his miserable new existance. Service to the Dark Lady seemed the only logical choice. Lordaeron was his home, after all. Who else but the undead would tolerate his presense now?\n\nWhile traveling through Silverpine he learned of an organization called the Hand of Lordaeron, whose Forsaken members sought to defend and reclaim their homeland from thieving Alliance and relentless Scourge alike. Intrigued, he joined their cause.\n\nAt first the Hand was merely a place to meet new friends and rest his feet. As time passed his dedication to Mortarion's goals deepened. The Hand blessed him with purpose and renewed vigor and he repays them in loyalty and the blood of their mutual enemies. \n\n{h1:c}The Forgotten Shadow{/h1}\n\nIn death Lyle's ambitions turned from giving life to ripping it away. While he will readily heal his companions when neccessity demands it (or they promise to repay him in drink) he claims to heal with \"Spite\" rather than Light. \n\nAs a follower of the Cult of the Forgotten Shadow, Lyle attempts to live by the three virtues of Respect, Tenacity, and Power. Strangely, his resentment for the Light does not prevent him from finding balance. The compulsion to lift up the weak and heal the wounded remains strong within his soul, stronger even than the Light's agonizing flames and inspired hatred, while the Shadow envelopes him in cold solace. It is the Shadow he favors. ",

Known to be a brutal yet direct and practical tribe, they were highly sought out as sellswords and mercenaries throughout Northrend and the Eastern Kingdoms.\n\nIt was this profession and reknown which would ultimately lead to their demise. In search of the dreadlord Varimathas, Prince Arthas of Lordaeron came to Northrend. And when his troops were recalled by King Terenas Menethil, the young prince hired mercenaries to burn his own ships to ensure there would be no withdraw.\n\nAmong those mercenaries were the Hoarfrost tribe. Upon completion of their contract the prince Betrayed the tribe, and told his men that they had attacked unprovoked. The Hoarfrost tribe was no match for a full expeditionary force from Lordaeron and was all but wiped out. Only Zol'Ran youngest son of High chieftain Gal'Jin survived as he had fallen through a thin patch of ice into a crevasse.\n\n{h1:c}Mueh'Jin{/h1}{col:269aff}\n\nUpon finding his way out of the labyrinthine  crevasse Zol'Ran returned to his village to see it utterly destroyed, and the corpses of his tribe strew about like refuse. Giving into despair he returned to the crevasse, believing that he should have died in the fall and would join his brothers and sisters on the other side.\n\nAs hunger and cold set in over the days he remained beneath the ice, a dark voice spoke to him,. beckoning him further into the earth. There he found a shapeless shadow that spoke to him of the Humans who had wronged him, of vengeance, and of death. The Hoarfrost could not be resurrected, but they could be avenged. Though to achieve this vengeance, Zol'Ran would forsake any peace on the other side. He would be bound in service to an ancient loa of death, and death does not let go of that which he claims.\n\nZol'Ran gouged his forearms with his tusks, letting his blood spill out onto the ice where they flowed into hoodoo symbols which made his eyes sting to look at with their foul power. The pact had been sealed. Zol'Ran was no more. He had pledged himself to Mueh'zala.\n\nThe dark loa bid him rise, enveloped him in shadows that he may walk unseen, taught him the ways of brewing poisons that he may kill with the merest cut, and bestowed upon him a new name. Mueh'Jin. The beginning to commemorate his new pact in service to Mueh'zala, the end to remember that he is the last elder, and thus chieftain, of the Hoarfrost tribe.[/col]\n\n{h2:c}The murder of Shonte Daude{/h2}{col:269aff}\n\n\nOn the night after midsommar, as the brightest day began to give way and the longest nights approach commenced, Mueh'jin was to claim a life in the name of his dark loa.\n\nThis life belonged to a Gilnean turned forsaken. As Gilneas was part of the alliance which had betrayed his tribe and now an abomination against death, Mueh'jin was all too pleased to snuff this one out.\n\nHe arrived on Fray island to witness a party. Grin, Redwoods, and Lordaeron filth all comingling. But he bided his time. The day commenced with a dueling tournament, precisely the rigorous activity to tire out his deader.\n\nIt then gave way to libations, another stroke of luck to dull the senses of that who was already dead. Preparing to strike, the band started playing music, and how fortuitous  that they would begin dancing, necessitating  the removal of armor.\n\nFinally Shonte addressed his gathered guests, but Mueh'jin interrupted. More honorable than the humans who had betrayed him, Mueh'jin allowed the Gilnean access to his weapon and a fighting chance.\n\nThe Gilnean fought well, but the poison coating Mueh'jins blade was tainted with the essence of death by Ueetay no Mueh'zala himself and would see Shonte Daude's eyes close permanently. Before he made his exit, Mueh'Jin places a branch from a cherry tree, and a shark tooth in each of Shonte's hands. After all what is death without a little theatrics...\n\nAs the party goers scavenged the isle a Tauren warrior was able to pick up his trail, tracking Mueh'Jin to a perch in a tree. With a subtlety unsualy for one of the Tauren, she approached undetected and attempted to dislodge Mueh'Jin from his perch. Caught unaware but with the agility and balance honed from a lifetime of skullduggery he managed to maintain his footing.\n\nSeeing no reason to not entertain his would be apprehender, Mueh'Jin allowed the Tauren to engage him in combat. A combat which did not go well for her as she was defeated with only minor injuries to Mueh'jin. However the poison which had coated his blade was formulated against the undead, not Tauren, and Mueh'zala's focus was on ensuring Shontes death was uninterrupted by the myriad of healers as they attempted, in vain, to save their friend. As such the Tauren escaped with non-life threatening wounds, but would carry a scar to remind her not to traipse with death.\n\nMueh'Jin made his escape from the isle, his work complete.[/col]\n\n{h2:c}Attack on the council{/h2}\n\n{col:269aff}\n\n Death follows war  as the moon follows the sun. And so it was that Mue'jin, bound agent of Ueetay no Mueh'zala found his was to the swamp of sorrows as a War Council was gathering.\n\nMue'Jin watched from one of his perches as members of the horde bearing the insignia of numerous guilds travelled to Stonard. Taking careful note of those in attendance. An orc warrior missing a tooth seemed to be the center of attention and commanding those in attendance. He was flanked by a priestess who seemed familiar but this was not the Akunda priestess, her mojo was familiar, yet different. A few Tauren were noted. Mostly carrying totems made of a crimson wood, but one in armor, this must be their bodyguard. And of course there were numerous souls of lordaeron, both those still loyal to the fallen kingdom and those who had found new purpose. Mue'Jin noted the presence of an owlbear as well. Which struck him as odd since none are known to roam this far south, as well as that of a cat which moved in a manner belying his shape, hinting at something far more than a mere feline.\n\nNumbers did not favor Mue'jin and he bided his time. Noting that those of prominence filed into the larger structure, while the remainder took up positions at the various gates and pathways to the town.\n\nSuch procedures would serve well to alert them of an attacking force, but had the opposite effect against a single assailant as many of them were isolated. Noting the vulnerability Mue'jin began to attack them one by one. His ultimate goal not to cause any lasting harm or reap souls for his loa. But to sow fear and distrust, that nowhere is safe from the Son of Time. To this end his blades remained unpoisoned.\n\nHowever he had underestimated the gathered strength of those in attendance. Many of the guards were incapacitated, or otherwise shown the frailty of their safety. Yet there were also those able to fend off the assassin.\n\nGrom'Chok of the blacktooth was the first such. Though he paid for it in blood, he was able to drive off the assassin back into the swamp and raise the alarm. Jani'tah, also of the blacktooth, betrayed the usual methods of warrior training such as honor and instead fought with the guile and treachery of one who was never formally trained, and instead had to survive on their own wits. Mue'Jin heard a fait \"HEK HEK HEK\" as he vaulted back over the walls to recoup.\n\nThe final blow came from a resourceful Longwalker, utilizing a burning torch to light the way Mue'jin was revealed from the shadows. Though taken by surprise himself, Mue'Jin attacked. His blades finding little purchase behind the armor of the longwalker, and unpoisoned as they were, he found himself having to fight defensively and make his escape. The longwalker would not be dissuaded however and pressed the attack. Fatigue and numerous minor injuries beginning to take their toll.\n\nAs the noise of the fight echoed through the swamp alarm cries were made and it would only be a matter of time before he was overwhelmed. Mue'Jin attempted to dazzle the Longwalker with grave dust before invoking his loa to return him to the shadows, sparing no time to see if his attempt had succeeded, only that he was able to make his escape before she could press her advantage further.\n\n\n",
