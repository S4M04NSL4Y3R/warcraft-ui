commit 9e4bd583893ec85c378238e73b23074ad50263c7
Author: Stefan Pedersen <sp@ceptu.com>

    Add projected XP rewards from current quests that are not yet completed.
    Quests that require you to "speak to" someone are now considered "completed". Thus, they are included in the XP sum.
    The options panel is now somewhat complete; it's possible to position the bar, lock/unlock the bars, and to reset the options.
