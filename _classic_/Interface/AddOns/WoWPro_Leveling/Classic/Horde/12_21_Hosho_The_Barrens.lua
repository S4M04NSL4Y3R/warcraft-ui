While he's doing this, start making long pulls and killing the Drudgers and Mercenaries to the west of you. When he works out the controls, he'll start walking West. Continue to make long pulls. It will take him a second or two to notice when you're fighting things, but stay close to him and he WILL notice eventually. Try not to let things run away. After a short while, the shredder will turn north up a ramp, and stop. When this happens, two Venture Co. mobs will spawn and attack you. It should be an easy fight.

C Samophlange Manual|QID|3924|M|60.0,4.1|N|Head out of Orgrimmar West Gate. Very close by you should find Boulder Lode Mine. Fight your way into the mine, and be VERY careful. This area is full of 17-18 mobs that run away at low health and are packed incredibly tightly. Also, because the area is so small inside the cave, respawn can and will bite you. At the back of the cave, you'll find Boss Copperplug.|

R Northwatch Hold|QID|891|M|44.6,59.2|M|60.4,53.0|N|Go back to Mangletooth and take the quest Spirit of the Wind. That will give you a nifty little speed buff, which will help us get to the next part that little bit quicker! Run north along the road, and then turn east towards Northwatch Hold. Stay on the road for as long as you can. Be careful to avoid the Bristlebacks on your way, the Thornweavers will root you, making it impossible to run from them. The speed buff you have should chop a bit of time off that journey, and should wear off just as you arrive. How convenient!|

K Cannoneer Smythe|QID|891|T|Cannoneer Smythe|QO|3|M|63.1,56.7N|Follow the path from the entrance, up to the top of the hill, then turn right and approach the West tower. If you get lost, use the map. Clear off any mobs around the tower. Inside this tower, you will find 3 mobs, one of which is a cloth-wearing healer. This is a tricky fight, but by no means impossible. If you have to, use the same tactic we used for Hezrul Bloodmark. Once all 3 of them are dead, climb the tower. At the top you will find Canoneer Smythe, and one guard. Take care of them both.|
K Cannoneer Whessan|QID|891|T|Cannoneer Whessan|QO|2|M|60.5,54.8|N|Now head to the East tower. Same routine as before, three guards on the ground level. Take them down, climb the tower, use any tactics you have and bring down Cannoneer Whessan, and leave the tower.|
K Captain Fairmount|QID|891|T|Captain Fairmount slain|QO|1|M|61.8,54.7|N|Head back down the hill, clear off the mobs around the keep, then prepare yourself again. There are 4 mobs in this room, but they will pull 2 at a time. Range the healer then run around a corner so she's out of your line of sight, and she'll come running round to get you. Once her and the marine are dead, kill the two marines guarding the Blood Elf. Do not take his quest yet. Once they're dead, fight your way to the top of the tower, moving slowly and carefully, and keeping your eyes open. At the top of the tower, you will find around 4 regular mobs, and Captain Fairmount. The regular mobs should pull one at a time, so clear the area off until Fairmount is alone. Then simply kill her.|
A Free From the Hold|QID|898|N|Once she is dead, Climb back down the tower and talk to Gilthares Firebough, the blood elf.|
C Free From the Hold|QID|898|N|Escort Gilthares. Try to stay about 10 feet in front of him, and pull things towards you. He has a terrible habbit of running headlong into clusters of mobs and pulling more than you need to fight. He is also very fragile, so don't let him tank things for too long if you can help it. He will walk down the hill, to the main gates of Northwatch, then rest for a short while before heading north through the pirate camps. Escort him all the way to Ratchet.|

He has a long-ish patrol route and a less than ideal respawn time, so you might not find him. If you do find him, kill him, and loot his hoof. This hoof starts a quest which is worth 1,300 exp. After you have killed him, or while you are looking for him, kill the Thunderheads in the area and loot their blood. Once you have 3 Thunder Lizard Bloods, head back to Camp Taurajo. (Don't worry if you don't find Lakota'mani, he isn't essential, and the 1.3k exp isn't really worth camping the area for0.|
