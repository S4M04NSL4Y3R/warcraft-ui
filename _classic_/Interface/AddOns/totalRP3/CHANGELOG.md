# Changelog version 1.6.5

## Added

- Added Total RP 3: Extended version number alongside Total RP 3 version number at the bottom of the tooltip.

## Fixed

- Fixed an error when someone executes a scan in your zone. (Classic only)
- Fixed a potential error when saving a glance slot.

# Changelog version 1.6.4

We are aware of a current issue on Retail causing **quest item usage from the objective tracker** to sometimes fail. While we do not have a fix for it just yet, **typing /reload after getting the error message** temporarily fixes the issue. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## WoW: Classic support

- Total RP 3: Classic is now available as a separate download on CurseForge and WoWInterface! Be sure to install it instead of the retail version of Total RP 3 if you plan on roleplaying in WoW: Classic.
- Important points to be aware of for the Classic version:
  - A few icons have been changed across the addon to replace missing icons in Classic.
  - Companion profiles have been disabled for mounts and non-combat pets, as Blizzard did not provide us with beta access. We will work on implementing them back as soon as possible.
  - Total RP 3: Extended will not be ported to Classic at launch. We will be evaluating if a Classic port makes sense for us to do at a later date.

## Changed

- When using the character map scan, characters with which you have set a relationship will now appear on top of the others.
