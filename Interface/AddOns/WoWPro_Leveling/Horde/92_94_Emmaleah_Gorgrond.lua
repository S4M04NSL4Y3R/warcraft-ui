-- Log: Added all treasure (with Item tags), non 100 named mobs (with item tags) and hardened vines/odd boulders. Set Rank for None, if you just want to get your book and ability to buy garrison plans.  2 is most of the quest content 3 includes all the treasure / rare mobs, etc. Added/improved a few notes, Added more R steps ... including one about avoiding Highpass. Removed all garrison building specific parts (since Ludo is making a new guide type that will include that) I left in fishing and Cordana's quest, but they should probably be deleted too.

-- Log: moved tangleheart quest section, fixed all |Z|tags, fixed many missing explanations, S/US, etc.  The lumberyard doesn't flow as well as the sparring arena and I don't think its because im trying to combine both in the same guide, I think it just flows poorly...
