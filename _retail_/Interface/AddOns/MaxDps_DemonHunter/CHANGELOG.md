- v8.2.1 - Added infernal strike as cooldown, cannot be in main rotation  
- Merge pull request #3 from chadlittle/chadlittle-patch-1  
    Add Infernal Strike to spell list and rotation  
- Fix cooldown timer  
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'refs/remotes/origin/master' into chadlittle-patch-1  
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'refs/remotes/kaminaris/master'  
- Add Infernal Strike to spell list and rotation  
    A few fixes:  
     - Infernal Strike was missing from Spell List and Rotations  
     - Fiery Brand is considered a "defensive" under simc, but is still used as top priority for damage.  
    I tested both a normal and brand rotation with these UI changes at a target dummy.
