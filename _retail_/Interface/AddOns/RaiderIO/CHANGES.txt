    Revert "Fixed an extremely rare issue where names changed by GM, but capitalized poorly, did not always find the players profile. Capitalization is now ignored when searching for the player profile to resolve this issue."
    
    Reverting this temporarily as it appears that it may be causing issues
    with special utf8 character names.
    
    This reverts commit be7fdfaaca1100b07fdc20bfa7639c94c604d84a.
