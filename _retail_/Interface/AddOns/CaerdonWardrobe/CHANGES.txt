    Fixes for Encounter Journal and loot spec switching
    
    When the Encounter Journal hadn't yet been opened, switching loot
    spec would cause an error.  I fixed this and noticed that when
    your toon is on auto loot spec, it wasn't correctly reflecting
    status on Encounter Journal, so I fixed that.
    
    I'm seeing some strange behavior where loot that should be valid
    for a spec is (maybe) misidentified for that spec, but it's not
    clear to me, yet, if I'm missing something, or if I'm actually
    tracking it correctly and the game is wrong (seems unlikely).
    
    At any rate, I don't think this is a new behavior, so I'm fixing
    the crash and will go from there as I get more info.
